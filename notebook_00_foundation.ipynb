    "## Purpose of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes the complete analytical foundation for the replication series accompanying the manuscript *When Do Charitable Remainder Unitrusts Outperform? A Monte Carlo Analysis* (Gottlieb, 2025), submitted to the *Journal of Financial Planning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains:\n",
    "1. Disclosure statement regarding AI assistance and the research/commercial distinction\n",
    "2. All simulation engine code, fully self-contained and annotated\n",
    "3. The baseline scenario (Table 1 of the manuscript), parameterized and justified\n",
    "4. An explanation of the paired-path Monte Carlo design\n",
    "5. The Gaussian return model with annotated equations\n",
    "6. Baseline visualizations that extend beyond those published in the paper\n",
    "7. A parameter documentation table specifying distributions and ranges used in subsequent notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this notebook series:** Each subsequent notebook (01 through 05) is fully self-contained and can be run independently. However, running this Foundation notebook first is recommended to confirm that all dependencies install correctly in your environment.\n",

    "## Disclosure Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Assistance.** Portions of this manuscript and the associated simulation code were developed with the assistance of large language model (LLM) AI tools. Specifically, LLM assistance was used in: (1) drafting and editing manuscript text; (2) developing and debugging Python simulation code; and (3) structuring the sensitivity analysis framework. All analytical results, parameter choices, actuarial calculations, and interpretations were reviewed and verified by the author. The author takes full responsibility for the accuracy of all claims made in the manuscript and in these notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research vs. Commercial Distinction.** The simulation engine presented in these notebooks is a research replication version derived from CalCRUT, a proprietary web-based decision-support tool available at https://calcrut2-wcl.pythonanywhere.com/. The replication code reproduces the specific analyses reported in the manuscript. The commercial tool includes additional features (PDF report generation, web interface, client management) not present here. This replication code is provided solely for peer review and academic verification purposes.\n",

    "### 2.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The charitable deduction available to a CRUT donor is governed by Internal Revenue Code §7520 and the accompanying Treasury Regulations (Treas. Reg. §1.664-4). The deduction equals the present value of the *charitable remainder* — the portion of the trust corpus expected to pass to charity at the end of the trust term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a standard CRUT paying a fixed percentage $p$ of the annually revalued trust corpus, the remainder factor $R$ is computed using IRS Table F timing adjustment factors and IRS life expectancy tables (for life trusts) or a fixed discount formula (for term-of-years trusts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The Table F Timing Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRS Table F factor $f$ adjusts for the timing of payments within the year and any lag between the trust valuation date and the first payment. For a payout rate $p$ and §7520 rate $i$, with $k$ payments per year:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f = \\frac{(1+i)^{1/k} - 1}{p / k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This factor converts the stated annual payout rate into an effective adjustment that accounts for the time value of interim payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Annual Remainder Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjusted payout rate $p^*$ is:\n",
    "$$p^* = 1 - (1 - p) \\cdot f$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a term-of-years trust with term $T$, the remainder factor is:\n",
    "$$R = (p^*)^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For life trusts, IRS actuarial tables provide the life expectancy $T_{\\text{IRS}}$, which is used in place of a fixed term. For two-life trusts, the joint life expectancy (last-to-die) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charitable deduction $D$ is:\n",
    "$$D = V_0 \\cdot R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V_0$ is the fair market value of the contributed asset. A CRUT qualifies only if $R \\geq 0.10$ (the 10% remainder test under IRC §664(d)(2))."

    "### 4.1 CRUT Portfolio Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, the CRUT portfolio evolves as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Growth:** $V_t = V_{t-1} \\cdot r_t$\n",
    "2. **Distribution:** $d_t = V_t \\cdot p$ (where $p$ is the stated payout rate)\n",
    "3. **Fee deduction:** Trustee fee $f_{\\text{trust}}$ applied to beginning-of-year corpus\n",
    "4. **After-fee value:** $V_t^{\\text{net}} = V_t \\cdot (1 - f_{\\text{trust}}) - d_t$\n",
    "5. **After-tax distribution:** $d_t^{\\text{net}} = d_t \\cdot (1 - \\tau_{\\text{ord}})$ where $\\tau_{\\text{ord}}$ is the combined federal/state ordinary income rate (CRUT distributions are taxed as ordinary income under the four-tier system)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Benchmark Portfolio Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxable benchmark represents the counterfactual: the donor retains the appreciated asset in a taxable account.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial value:** $B_0 = V_0 + D \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{ord}}$ (contributed FMV plus the invested tax savings from the foregone deduction)\n",
    "2. **Growth:** $B_t = B_{t-1} \\cdot r_t$\n",
    "3. **Turnover tax drag:** Each year, $\\theta$ fraction of gains are realized and taxed at the combined LTCG rate $\\tau_{\\text{cg}}$. Tax drag per dollar = $\\theta \\cdot (r_t - 1) \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{cg}}$\n",
    "4. **Management fee:** $f_{\\text{bench}}$ applied annually\n",
    "5. **Terminal liquidation:** At end of horizon, remaining embedded gains are taxed at $\\tau_{\\text{cg}}$ (liquidation scenario)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Terminal Wealth Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminal net benefit is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\Delta W_T = W_T^{\\text{CRUT}} - W_T^{\\text{bench}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_T^{\\text{CRUT}}$ is the present value of all after-tax CRUT distributions plus the present value of the charitable deduction tax saving, and $W_T^{\\text{bench}}$ is the after-tax liquidation value of the benchmark portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Win probability** is the fraction of paths where $\\Delta W_T > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Note on Step-Up in Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark as implemented assumes the donor liquidates the portfolio at the end of the simulation horizon and pays capital gains tax on appreciation. This is the *liquidation benchmark*. An alternative benchmark — the *step-up benchmark* — assumes the donor holds the asset to death and heirs receive a stepped-up basis under IRC §1014, eliminating the capital gains liability entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step-up benchmark materially favors the taxable alternative and is examined in Notebook 02 (Asset Basis). Planners should consider which benchmark is more appropriate for a specific client situation."

    "**Why these values?** The baseline represents a plausible but not extreme planning scenario: a married couple in their early-to-mid 60s, contributing a moderately appreciated asset ($1M FMV, 20% basis), with a standard quarterly-paying CRUT. Tax rates reflect a high-income California household. The 7% expected return and 12% volatility are consistent with a broadly diversified equity-oriented portfolio over long horizons (consistent with historical S&P 500 geometric mean returns net of inflation, plus a fixed-income component).\n",

It represents an **actively managed** taxable portfolio — appropriate for the advisor-managed accounts that CRUT donors typically hold.
