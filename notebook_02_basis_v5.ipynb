A Monte Carlo Analysis*\n### Klaus Gottlieb, JD, MS, MBA \u2014 Wealth Care Lawyer, Cayucos, CA\n\n---\n\n## Purpose and Scope\n\nThis notebook extends the baseline analysis to a **three-benchmark framework** that addresses two peer review comments while simultaneously modeling the most realistic planning scenario facing concentrated position holders.\n\n### Peer Review Comments Addressed\n\n> **Comment #3:** *\"The benchmark 60% turnover seems high.\"*\n\n> **Comment #4:** *\"The analysis ignores a step-up in basis for the benchmark (which would essentially eliminate the tax liability and favor the benchmark over the CRUT).\"*\n\nAs established in earlier analysis, these two comments are structurally linked and cannot be addressed independently. Comment #3 affects how much unrealized gain accumulates in the benchmark portfolio; Comment #4 determines what happens to that unrealized gain at death. Lowering turnover (Comment #3) makes the step-up (Comment #4) more consequential, because a low-turnover portfolio accumulates more unrealized gain for the step-up to protect.\n\nThis notebook addresses both comments across all four turnover levels (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%) by adding a third benchmark that represents the most realistic planning alternative.\n\n---\n\n## The Three-Benchmark Framework\n\nThe central question in a CRUT consultation is never abstract. A client sits across the table holding a specific asset \u2014 typically a concentrated position with low basis and high volatility. The relevant alternatives are:\n\n### Benchmark 1: Hold to Liquidation\n*\"I keep the asset and sell it sometime before I die.\"*\n\nThe donor retains the appreciated asset in a taxable account. Capital gains are realized gradually through annual portfolio turnover. At the end of the simulation horizon (the actuarial life expectancy of the two beneficiaries), the donor (or their estate) liquidates the portfolio and pays LTCG tax on the remaining unrealized gain.\n\n**This was the only benchmark in the submitted manuscript.** It is appropriate for clients who would otherwise sell the asset during their lifetime \u2014 for example, a business founder who is considering an exit.\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- Starting corpus: \\\\$1,000,000 (same as CRUT)\n- Starting basis: \\\\$200,000 (20% of FMV)\n- Turnover: 0\u201360% annually\n- Terminal event: LTCG tax on remaining unrealized gain\n\n### Benchmark 2: Hold to Death (Step-Up)\n*\"I keep the asset and hold it until I die. My heirs inherit it.\"*\n\nThe donor retains the appreciated asset but specifically intends to hold it until death, allowing heirs to receive a stepped-up basis under IRC \u00a71014. The embedded capital gain is permanently eliminated. This is the reviewer's concern.\n\n**This is the most favorable possible benchmark assumption for the holdstrategy.** It is appropriate for clients with estate planning motives \u2014 specifically, those whose primary alternative to the CRUT is a testamentary bequest of the appreciated asset.\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- Starting corpus: \\\\$1,000,000 (same as CRUT)\n- Starting basis: \\\\$200,000, but stepped up to FMV at death (no terminal CG tax)\n- Turnover: 0\u201360% annually\n- Terminal event: No LTCG tax (basis resets to FMV at death)\n\n**Important caveat:** Because the CRUT transfers the asset irrevocably to the trust, the charitable remainder passes to charity, not to heirs. There is no step-up on the trust corpus. Benchmark 2 captures the full economic value of the step-up that the CRUT permanently forfeits.\n\n### Benchmark 3: Liquidate and Reinvest\n*\"I sell the concentrated position today, pay the tax, and reinvest in a diversified portfolio.\"*\n\nThe donor liquidates the concentrated position immediately, pays LTCG + NIIT + state tax on the full embedded gain, and reinvests the after-tax proceeds in a diversified portfolio identical in risk and return to the CRUT's investment strategy.\n\n**This benchmark is added in this revision and was not in the submitted manuscript.** It represents the most realistic alternative for the clients most likely to be considering a CRUT \u2014 holders of concentrated, illiquid, or highly volatile positions who are motivated to diversify.\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- Gross FMV: \\\\$1,000,000\n- Embedded gain: \\\\$800,000 (at 20% basis)\n- Immediate tax: \\\\$800,000 \u00d7 (20% LTCG + 3.8% NIIT + 9.3% state) = \\\\$800,000 \u00d7 33.1% = **\\\\$264,800**\n- Starting corpus after tax: **\\\\$735,200** (the benchmark starts here, not at \\\\$1,000,000)\n- Starting basis: \\\\$735,200 (clean \u2014 full step-up to reinvestment cost)\n- Future turnover drag: applies only to gains above \\\\$735,200\n- Return and volatility: identical to CRUT (\u03bc = 7%, \u03c3 = 12% after diversification)\n- Terminal event: LTCG tax on remaining unrealized gain above \\\\$735,200 basis\n\n**The key economic insight of Benchmark 3:** The CRUT starts with \\\\$1,000,000 at work on day one. The liquidation-reinvest benchmark starts with only \\\\$735,200. The CRUT must generate sufficient distributions and deduction benefits to overcome the benchmark's eventual compounding advantage, but the benchmark begins with a structural 26.5% capital deficit.\n\nThis deficit has a counterintuitive implication: at *low* turnover, Benchmark 3 is actually *easier* for the CRUT to beat than Benchmark 1. At low turnover, the hold-liquidation benchmark (Benchmark 1) retains the full \\\\$1,000,000 and defers the embedded gain tax for 33 years \u2014 effectively borrowing \\\\$264,800 interest-free at the pre-tax return rate. At high turnover, this advantage is eroded annually, making Benchmark 1 less competitive.\n\n---\n\n## The Concentrated Position Context: Why Volatility Matters\n\nA concentrated position typically carries substantially higher volatility than a diversified portfolio. A single-stock position or a real estate holding might have \u03c3 = 25\u201340%, compared to \u03c3 = 12% for a diversified equity portfolio.\n\n**In this analysis, both the CRUT and the liquidation-reinvest benchmark diversify immediately.** The CRUT diversifies upon contribution (it can sell the concentrated position tax-free and reinvest in a diversified portfolio). The benchmark diversifies upon liquidation. Both then carry \u03c3 = 12% going forward.\n\nThis means the volatility reduction benefit of diversification is symmetric \u2014 it does not favor either strategy. What *does* favor the CRUT is that it achieves this diversification without the immediate tax hit that Benchmark 3 incurs.\n\nThe hold benchmarks (1 and 2) retain the concentrated position. In this notebook, they are modeled at \u03c3 = 12% (same as the diversified portfolio) for two reasons:\n1. Consistency with Notebooks 00\u201301, which also use \u03c3 = 12%\n2. Conservatism: using higher \u03c3 for the hold benchmarks would favor the CRUT (higher variance increases the risk of large benchmark losses, which the CRUT avoids)\n\nA higher \u03c3 for the hold benchmarks is therefore the subject of a separate robustness check (Notebook 05) rather than the baseline analysis here.\n\n---\n\n## Zone Framework with Three Benchmarks\n\nWith three benchmarks, the planning zones become more nuanced:\n\n| Zone | Condition | Recommendation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Deep Green** | CRUT wins all three benchmarks (all \u2265 50%) | CRUT recommended regardless of client exit strategy |\n| **Medium Green** | CRUT wins hold benchmarks; loses liq-reinvest (< 50%) | CRUT recommended if client intends to hold; consider alternatives if client plans to sell and diversify |\n| **Yellow** | CRUT wins hold-liquidation only; loses step-up and liq-reinvest | CRUT only recommended if client will sell during life AND has no estate planning intent |\n| **Red** | CRUT loses all three benchmarks (all < 50%) | CRUT not recommended |\n\nNote: Because Benchmark 3 starts with less capital, the Deep Green zone (CRUT beats all three) is *larger* than the Green zone in the two-benchmark framework. The CRUT's full-corpus starting advantage works in its favor here.\n\n---\n\n## Figures Produced\n\n1. **Win probability curves at 20% turnover** \u2014 all three benchmarks vs. basis fraction\n2. **Win probability curves at 60% turnover** \u2014 all three benchmarks vs. basis fraction\n3. **Win probability at baseline (20% basis)** \u2014 bar chart across all four turnover levels \u00d7 three benchmarks\n4. **Four-zone traffic light at 20% turnover** \u2014 all three benchmarks simultaneously\n5. **Four-zone traffic light at 60% turnover** \u2014 all three benchmarks simultaneously\n6. **Gap chart** \u2014 two gaps: (a) cost of step-up assumption; (b) benefit of starting corpus advantage over liq-reinvest\n7. **Planning decision table** \u2014 zone boundaries at all four turnover levels, all three benchmarks\n8. **Heatmap** \u2014 basis \u00d7 turnover for the liquidation-reinvest benchmark specifically\n\n---\n\n## Ground Truth from Prior Notebooks\n\n- Baseline win probability (20% turnover, hold-liquidation): see Notebook 00 output\n- Charitable deduction: \\\\$126,389 | Remainder factor: 0.1264 | PV tax benefit: \\\\$58,518\n- Asset basis ranks **#5** of 12 parameters in OAT sensitivity (27.4pp range)\n- Simulation horizon: **33 years** (Two Life 63/65 joint actuarial expectancy)\n\n---",

It answers the question most relevant to concentrated position holders: what happens if the client simply sells and diversifies today?\n\n**The key structural insight from these curves:**\n\nThe liquidation-reinvest benchmark is typically *between* the two hold benchmarks in terms of difficulty for the CRUT. At low basis levels, the CRUT's full \\\\$1M starting corpus advantage over the \\\\$735,200 reinvested corpus is large enough that the CRUT wins even against the liq-reinvest benchmark. At higher basis levels, the immediate tax on liquidation is smaller, so the reinvested corpus approaches \\\\$1M, and the curves converge.\n\nAt 0% turnover, an interesting reversal may occur: the hold-liquidation benchmark becomes harder than the liq-reinvest benchmark at some basis levels. This is because at 0% turnover, the hold-liquidation benchmark retains the full \\\\$1M corpus with no annual drag \u2014 effectively borrowing \\\\$264K interest-free at the pre-tax return rate for 33 years. At high turnover this advantage disappears as annual drag erodes the hold benchmark.",

   "source": "---\n### Figure 3 \u2014 Interpretation: Benchmark Hierarchy, Tax Timing, and Client Selection\n\nThe vertical axis in Figure 3 measures the CRUT's win probability \u2014 the fraction\nof simulated paths on which the CRUT produces greater present-value personal\nwealth than the specified benchmark. A lower bar therefore denotes a *stronger*\nalternative for the donor, not a weaker one. The hold-to-death benchmark\n(IRC \u00a71014, red) consistently presents the lowest CRUT win probability and\naccordingly constitutes the CRUT's most formidable competitor; the\nliquidate-and-reinvest benchmark (green) the least. This ordering is\nstructurally determined by the timing of tax recognition, and is not sensitive\nto the return assumption within the parameter ranges examined.\n\n**Tax-timing asymmetry and its compounding consequences**\n\nThe three benchmarks impose their tax costs at fundamentally different points\nin the temporal structure of the comparison. The hold-to-death benchmark defers\ncapital gains recognition indefinitely: during the simulation horizon the\nbenchmark incurs only the annual turnover drag on realized appreciation; at the\nterminal date IRC \u00a71014 extinguishes the entire embedded gain through a\nstepped-up basis. The benchmark therefore enters the simulation at the full\nfair market value, compounds on that corpus throughout the actuarial horizon,\nand exits without terminal tax liability. The CRUT's structural advantage \u2014 a\ncharitable deduction whose present value is fixed at the date of contribution \u2014\ndoes not scale with realized market performance. At high expected returns the\nbenchmark's compounding advantage on a full, tax-deferred corpus increasingly\ndominates the fixed deduction benefit, which explains the pattern observed in\nboth Figure 3 and the sensitivity analysis of Notebook 01, where expected return\nranks as the parameter with the greatest influence on CRUT outcomes.\n\nThe liquidate-and-reinvest benchmark, by contrast, front-loads its entire tax\nliability at inception. At the baseline parameters ($1M FMV, 20% basis,\nCalifornia rates), the benchmark incurs $264,800 in combined federal and state\ncapital gains tax on day one, commencing the simulation with a reinvestment\ncorpus of $735,200 \u2014 a 26.5% permanent deficit relative to the CRUT's\ncontributed corpus. At a 7% mean annual return over the corrected 25-year\nactuarial horizon, the terminal value of that foregone capital exceeds $1.4M\nin expectation. The CRUT's deduction benefit (approximately $88,000 present\nvalue at corrected actuarial parameters) offsets a small fraction of this\ndeficit, and the CRUT wins the comparison not through superiority of structure\nbut because the benchmark has inflicted a substantial self-imposed cost before\nthe simulation begins. The elevated CRUT win probability against this benchmark\nshould accordingly be interpreted as a measure of the *immediate-liquidation\ntax penalty*, not as an unqualified endorsement of the CRUT's economic\nperformance.\n\n**Client selection and the applicable counterfactual**\n\nThe benchmark hierarchy has a direct implication for client identification that\nis underrepresented in the practitioner literature. The economically relevant\ncomparison for any given donor is not the full ensemble of benchmarks examined\nhere but the single counterfactual that most accurately describes the\ndonor's realistic alternative to the CRUT contribution.\n\nFor a donor in good health with a long investment horizon, natural heirs, and\na pre-existing buy-and-hold disposition, the hold-to-death counterfactual is\ncontrolling. Against that alternative, the CRUT wins fewer than 43% of\nsimulations at 20% annual turnover and fewer than 22% at 0% turnover. In\nthis client profile the step-up benefit available under IRC \u00a71014 functions\nas an economically dominant substitute for the charitable deduction: it\neliminates the same embedded gain without requiring an irrevocable charitable\ntransfer, without subjecting distributions to ordinary income tax rates, and\nwithout the trust administration costs reflected in the trust fee parameter.\nThe CRUT becomes the preferred structure for this client only when turnover\nis sufficiently high that annual tax drag materially erodes the step-up's\nvalue, or when longevity projections are sufficiently uncertain that the\ndeferral embedded in the step-up is heavily discounted.\n\nFor a donor who is independently disposed to diversify a concentrated position\n\u2014 that is, for whom the alternative to the CRUT is not continued holding but\nimmediate sale and reinvestment of after-tax proceeds \u2014 the liquidate-and-reinvest\ncounterfactual is controlling, and the step-up is already foregone. For that\ndonor the economically relevant question reduces to whether to recognize the\ngain immediately or to contribute the appreciated asset to a CRUT and thereby\ndefer gain recognition while investing the full pretax corpus. At 20% annual\nturnover the corrected engine shows the CRUT competitive (50.4% win probability)\nand at 40\u201360% turnover increasingly favorable (54\u201356%), independent of\ncharitable motivation. This finding suggests that the threshold for recommending\na CRUT to a concentrated-position holder who intends to diversify is\nsubstantially lower than the threshold applicable to a donor with a continuing\nhold disposition \u2014 a distinction that a single-benchmark analysis obscures.\n\nThese results support restricting the primary CRUT client profile to donors\nwho present the liquidate-and-reinvest counterfactual: those holding\nconcentrated low-basis positions, facing near-term liquidity or diversification\nrequirements, with charitable intent as a complementary rather than threshold\ncriterion. The hold-to-death comparison remains relevant as a robustness\ncheck and for estate planning integration, but its low CRUT win probability at\nmoderate turnover levels counsels against treating the CRUT as a universally\ndominant structure across the full range of concentrated-position planning\nscenarios.\n"

This gap was analyzed in depth in the prior notebook version and directly addresses Reviewer Comment #4. As established earlier, this gap is small at high turnover (most gains already realized and taxed annually) and large at low turnover (unrealized gains accumulate for the step-up to protect).\n\n**Gap B: The liquidation-reinvest differential** = `win_prob(hold_liq) - win_prob(liquidation_reinvest)`\n\nThis is the win probability difference between the hold-liquidation benchmark and the liquidation-reinvest benchmark. A **positive** gap B means the CRUT does *better* against the liq-reinvest benchmark than against the hold-liquidation benchmark \u2014 meaning the liq-reinvest is easier for the CRUT to beat because of the immediate tax hit.\n\nA **negative** gap B would mean the liq-reinvest benchmark is harder to beat than hold-liquidation \u2014 which could occur at very high basis levels (minimal immediate tax hit, so the benchmark starts close to \\\\$1M) combined with low turnover (the hold benchmark suffers little annual drag).\n\n**The two gaps together answer both reviewer comments cleanly.** Gap A quantifies the cost of the step-up assumption.

This is the benchmark most relevant for the primary CRUT client population \u2014 concentrated position holders considering a diversification exit.\n\n**How to use this chart:**\nLocate a client on the chart using their asset's basis fraction (horizontal axis) and the turnover assumption for their reinvested portfolio (vertical axis). The color indicates the approximate CRUT win probability. Points above-left of the 50% contour favor the CRUT.\n\n**Key structural features to observe:**\n\n1. The 50% contour slopes downward from left to right \u2014 as basis increases, a higher turnover is needed for the CRUT to remain competitive. This is because higher basis means a smaller immediate tax hit on liquidation, which shrinks the CRUT's starting corpus advantage.\n\n2. At very low basis (near-zero), the CRUT wins across a wide range of turnover assumptions \u2014 the immediate tax hit on a \\\\$980K gain is so large (\\\\$324K) that the reinvested benchmark starts with only \\\\$676K, which the CRUT's \\\\$1M corpus comfortably outcompetes.\n\n3. The heatmap for the liquidation-reinvest benchmark is notably more favorable to the CRUT than the equivalent heatmap for the hold-liquidation benchmark, because of the starting corpus deficit.\n\n**This figure should be included in the manuscript revision as Figure X** alongside the hold-liquidation heatmap for direct visual comparison.",
