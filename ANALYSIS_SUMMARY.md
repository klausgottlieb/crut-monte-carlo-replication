## Master Parameter Sensitivity Ranking

Generated by the one-at-a-time (OAT) sweep in NB-01. Each parameter is swept across its realistic planning range; all others are held at baseline. The range column is the maximum minus minimum win probability across that sweep — the OAT sensitivity score.

| Rank | Parameter | OAT Range | Notebook(s) | Direction |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Expected return μ | ~55 pp | NB-01, NB-06 | Higher μ → CRUT wins more |
| 2 | Longevity adjustment | ~39 pp | NB-03 | Longer life → CRUT wins more |
| 3 | Benchmark fee / drag | ~31 pp | NB-01 | Higher bench fee → CRUT wins more |
| 4 | Payout rate | ~29 pp | NB-04 | Non-monotonic — interior optimum |
| 5 | Asset basis fraction | ~27 pp | NB-01, NB-04 | Lower basis → CRUT wins more |
| 6 | Turnover rate | ~24 pp | NB-00 – NB-06 | Higher turnover → CRUT wins more |
| 7 | Return volatility σ | ~18 pp | NB-06 | Varies — see robustness section |
| 8 | State tax rate | ~16 pp | NB-05 | Higher state rate → CRUT wins more |
| 9 | Trust fee | ~12 pp | NB-01 | Lower fee → CRUT wins more |
| 10 | Payout frequency | ~7 pp | NB-01 | Quarterly vs. annual minor |
| 11 | AGI / deduction absorption | ~4 pp | NB-01 | Full absorption slightly better |
| 12 | §7520 rate | ~0 pp | NB-04 | Near-zero net effect (channels cancel) |

## NB-00 · Turnover Baseline

**Establishing the Three-Benchmark Framework**

### What Was Built

Before any parameter sweep is possible, the manuscript needs a clear, defensible answer to "compared to what?" Three benchmark strategies are implemented:

| Benchmark | Description | Represents |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Hold-Liquidation** | Hold appreciated asset; pay CG tax only at the end of the horizon | The tax-optimal deferral case — the hardest benchmark for the CRUT to beat |
| **Hold-Step-Up** | Hold asset; receive stepped-up basis at death; no CG tax ever paid | The estate-planning alternative; relevant when the donor intends to pass the asset to heirs |
| **Liquidation-Reinvest** | Sell immediately; pay CG tax; reinvest after-tax proceeds | The most common real-world alternative — what most donors actually do |

Turnover levels of **0%, 20%, 40%, and 60%** are introduced as the primary moderating variable. Turnover captures annual portfolio rebalancing and its associated CG tax drag on the benchmark. The 60% level corresponds to the original manuscript's baseline; lower levels represent more tax-efficient benchmark management.

### Critical Technical Finding: The Deduction Formula Bug

> ⚠️ **Bug discovered and corrected — affects all notebooks**
>
> | | Formula | Deduction |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Original (broken)** | `period_rate / (i / freq)` | $0 |
> | **Correct (IRS Reg. §1.664-4(e)(3) Table F)** | `i / (freq × ((1 + i)^(1/freq) − 1))` | $126,389 |
>
> The correct formula yields a PV tax benefit of **$58,518** at baseline parameters. All win probabilities computed before this fix were conservative — the CRUT's advantage was systematically understated. The fix is applied uniformly in NB-00 through NB-06.

### Manuscript Implication

The three-benchmark framework gives reviewers a clear answer to "compared to what?" — the most common criticism of CRUT performance claims. Using the hold-liquidation benchmark (the strongest possible comparison) demonstrates CRUT superiority in the most conservative scenario. The turnover sweep shows practitioners that the CRUT advantage scales continuously with how tax-inefficiently the benchmark is managed, not as a binary outcome.

## NB-01 · Sensitivity Analysis

**One-at-a-Time Parameter Ranking**

### What Was Built

NB-01 is the central methodological exhibit. A systematic OAT sensitivity analysis runs across all 12 parameters, producing the [ranking table above](#master-parameter-sensitivity-ranking). Each parameter is swept across its realistic planning range while all others are held at baseline.

The OAT design — rather than a full factorial design — is standard in practitioner-facing financial research. It produces interpretable, actionable findings: "longevity matters twice as much as asset basis" is a sentence a financial planner can use. A full factorial design would be computationally prohibitive and would produce interaction terms that are difficult to communicate to a non-specialist audience.

### Key Findings

- **Expected return μ (rank #1, ~55 pp)** dominates all other parameters. This is the most important planning variable — and the one over which neither the donor nor the planner has control at inception. It motivates the robustness analysis in NB-06.
- **Longevity (rank #2, ~39 pp)** is the most important client-specific variable. It motivates the dedicated analysis in NB-03.
- **The §7520 rate ranks last (#12, ~0 pp).** This is the counterintuitive finding practitioners most commonly contest. It is explained mechanically in NB-04.
- **Turnover (rank #6) interacts with basis (rank #5):** at zero turnover, basis is irrelevant — there is no annual tax drag regardless of embedded gain. This interaction motivates the heatmap analyses in later notebooks.

### Manuscript Implication

The ranking table becomes Table 1 in the manuscript — the structural spine of the entire results section. Each subsequent section references it directly. The OAT design justifies the paper's scope: 12 parameters are examined because the OAT identifies them as the complete set of economically relevant inputs. The §7520 result at rank #12 is the manuscript's most surprising finding; NB-04 provides the mechanistic decomposition needed to defend it against reviewer challenges.

## NB-02 · Benchmark Deep Dive

**Hold-Step-Up and Liquidation-Reinvest Mechanics**

### What Was Built

NB-02 examines the two secondary benchmarks in depth. Two specific client populations face structurally different decisions:

- **The estate-planning client** who plans to hold the asset until death and pass it to heirs with a stepped-up basis under IRC §1014. For this client, the opportunity cost of the CRUT is not CG tax deferral but the full step-up benefit — typically worth $75,000–$150,000 at baseline parameters. The CRUT is a much harder sell to this client.
- **The liquidating client** who would otherwise sell immediately and reinvest. For this client, the CRUT offers the combined advantage of avoiding the immediate CG tax hit (approximately $133,000–$165,000 at baseline) plus the ongoing deduction benefit.

### Key Findings

- **Against the hold-step-up benchmark,** the CRUT loses in the majority of scenarios at low turnover. The step-up benefit is too large for the deduction and distribution advantages to overcome.
- **Against the liquidation-reinvest benchmark,** the CRUT wins in the majority of scenarios across a wide range of turnover levels.
- **The two benchmark curves cross** as turnover increases. At high annual turnover, even the step-up benchmark becomes beatable because benchmark tax drag accumulates over the trust's life.

### Manuscript Implication

The manuscript's advice to practitioners depends critically on which benchmark is appropriate for each client. The step-up analysis supports the recommendation that CRUTs are poorly suited to clients who plan to hold to death — unless the asset would otherwise generate high annual tax drag. The liquidation-reinvest result supports the primary affirmative claim: for the client who would otherwise sell, the CRUT is the dominant strategy across a wide range of plausible parameters. Together, these findings define the **target client profile:** a donor who (a) holds a highly appreciated asset, (b) needs liquidity or income, and (c) would otherwise sell rather than hold to death.

## NB-03 · Longevity Analysis

**The #2 Parameter — Five Sections, Six Figures**

### What Was Built

NB-03 is the dedicated treatment of longevity — ranked #2 with a 39 pp OAT range. Five analytical sections cover every clinically relevant angle:

| Figure | Analysis | Clinical Question Answered |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| Fig 1 | Longevity adjustment sweep (−10 to +15 yr) | What if this client lives longer/shorter than IRS tables predict? |
| Fig 2 | Starting age sweep (ages 45–75) | What is the optimal donor age for CRUT formation? |
| Fig 3 | Age drivers decomposition | Why is the age curve non-monotonic? (competing horizon vs. deduction effects) |
| Fig 4 | Single life vs. two life | How much does adding a second beneficiary change the economics? |
| Fig 5 | Longevity × return interaction heatmap | Do longevity and return expectations interact or operate independently? |
| Fig 6 | Four archetypal client profiles | What does this mean for the young couple, the baseline couple, the older couple, and the health-adjusted baseline? |

### Key Findings

- **Longer longevity monotonically increases win probability.** Each additional year beyond IRS expectancy adds CRUT distributions while extending the horizon over which benchmark tax drag accumulates. The effect is approximately linear in the central range.
- **The age curve (Fig 2) is non-monotonic.** Younger donors have longer expected horizons (favors CRUT) but smaller deductions (disfavors CRUT — the remainder factor is compressed by longer expected payouts). The optimum is in the mid-50s to early 60s depending on turnover level.
- **Two Life vs. Single Life:** Adding a second beneficiary extends the joint horizon (favors CRUT) but further compresses the deduction (disfavors CRUT). The net Two Life advantage is modest — typically 3–8 pp — but positive across almost all age combinations.
- **The longevity × return interaction (Fig 5)** shows a curved 50% contour, confirming the two parameters interact: at high expected returns, additional longevity years are more valuable because the benchmark's compounding power increases with each year added to the horizon.

### Editorial Note: Adverse Selection Framing

Longevity adjustment is presented as a **planning scenario analysis, not a population claim.** The notebook avoids stating that CRUT donors are healthier than the general population (though this is documented in the annuities literature). The framing used throughout: *"Given that a client enters a CRUT, how does win probability change if the client lives longer than IRS tables predict?"* The healthy baseline profile (+7 yr adjustment) is labeled as a "planning sensitivity check" in both markdown and figure titles.

### Manuscript Implication

The longevity analysis answers the question every planner asks: "My client is in excellent health and expects to live to 95 — does that change the analysis?" Fig 1 quantifies it precisely. The age curve (Fig 2) supports a concrete recommendation: for otherwise equivalent clients, earlier formation in the mid-50s to early 60s tends to maximize the CRUT advantage. The four archetypal profiles in Fig 6 are ready to use as manuscript tables or sidebars. The longevity × return interaction supports the recommendation to consider the client's investment strategy when evaluating CRUT suitability — the two variables compound each other.

## NB-04 · Payout Rate and §7520 Rate

**The Design Choice and the Counterintuitive Finding**

### What Was Built

NB-04 examines two parameters with contrasting significance: the payout rate (rank #4, ~29 pp) and the §7520 rate (rank #12, ~0 pp). They are paired because both are set at trust inception and because their contrasting rankings tell a coherent economic story about the internal consistency of the IRS valuation framework.

### The Payout Rate: Interior Optimum

The payout rate has two simultaneous and opposing effects:

1. **Higher payout → more distributions** — more income to beneficiaries. Favorable.
2. **Higher payout → smaller deduction** — the higher payout reduces the IRS remainder factor R, which reduces the charitable deduction. As R approaches the 10% floor required by IRC §664(d)(2)(D), the deduction approaches zero.

The result is a **non-monotonic relationship** between payout rate and win probability. There is an interior maximum within the permissible range (5% minimum to the ~7.9% ceiling at Two Life 63/65 and a 5% §7520 rate). This is the manuscript's central design recommendation: the payout rate should be set to maximize win probability — not to maximize beneficiary income (which pushes toward the ceiling) and not to maximize the deduction (which pushes toward 5%).

### The §7520 Rate: Near-Zero Net Effect

The §7520 rate enters the CRUT economics through two channels of nearly equal magnitude and opposing direction:

| Channel | Effect | Direction |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Deduction channel** | Higher §7520 rate → larger Table F → smaller adjusted payout → higher R → larger deduction → more PV tax benefit | Favors CRUT |
| **Discount rate channel** | §7520 rate also used to present-value future distributions. Higher rate → each distribution worth less in PV terms today | Disfavors CRUT |

These effects nearly exactly cancel because they operate over the same time horizon via the same present-value mechanism. The IRS designed the §7520 rate to be internally consistent — it is supposed to be the appropriate actuarial discount rate for these transfers — and this consistency produces the cancellation.

The three-condition experimental design in Figs 5–6 isolates each channel:
- **Condition A:** both `rate_7520` and `pv_rate` vary together (real world) → flat win probability curve
- **Condition B:** only `rate_7520` varies, `pv_rate` fixed (deduction effect only) → rising win probability
- **Condition C:** only `pv_rate` varies, `rate_7520` fixed (discounting effect only) → falling win probability

Condition A range << Condition B and C individually: the cancellation is confirmed.

### Manuscript Implication

**Payout rate:** Fig 1 (win prob vs. payout rate with 10% test boundary shaded) is a direct planning tool. Fig 4 (optimal payout vs. donor age) provides an age-indexed table for use when drafting the trust instrument.

**§7520 rate:** The decomposition figures provide the mechanistic answer reviewers will demand. The planning implication — do not time CRUT formation around §7520 rate levels — is one of the manuscript's most actionable and counterintuitive recommendations, explicitly correcting the common practitioner belief that "higher §7520 rates are always better for CRUTs."

## NB-05 · State Tax Sweep

**National Practice Implications**

### What Was Built

NB-05 extends the analysis from its California baseline to the full U.S. state tax spectrum. The manuscript targets the *Journal of Financial Planning* — a national publication — and the baseline California rates (9.3% ordinary, 9.3% capital gains) need to be justified as representative.

Eleven representative states are modeled:

| State | Ordinary Rate | CG Rate | Notes |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------|
| TX / FL / NV | 0.0% | 0.0% | No state income tax |
| AZ | 2.5% | 2.5% | Flat tax |
| PA | 3.07% | 3.07% | Flat tax |
| CO | 4.4% | 4.4% | Flat tax |
| NY | 6.85% | 6.85% | Middle bracket |
| WI | 7.65% | 7.65% | Upper bracket |
| CA (baseline) | 9.3% | 9.3% | Upper bracket at $500K AGI |
| MN | 9.85% | 9.85% | Top bracket |
| OR | 9.9% | 9.9% | Top bracket |
| HI | 11.0% | 7.25% | Differentiated CG rate |
| CA (top) | 13.3% | 13.3% | Top bracket (AGI > $1M) |

### The Three-Channel Framework

| Channel | Applies To | Direction | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Ch1 — Benchmark drag** | State CG rate on annual benchmark turnover | Favors CRUT | Higher state rate → more annual drag on benchmark |
| **Ch2 — Distribution tax** | State ordinary rate on CRUT distributions | Disfavors CRUT | Higher state rate → distributions worth less |
| **Ch3 — Deduction value** | State ordinary rate on deduction savings | Favors CRUT | Higher state rate → deduction saves more tax |

### Key Findings

- **The net effect of state taxes is positive for the CRUT.** Channels 1 and 3 together outweigh Channel 2. Win probability increases monotonically with state tax rate at all four turnover levels.
- **The CA 9.3% baseline adds approximately 8–14 pp** of win probability compared to a no-tax state, depending on turnover — meaning California practitioners have a stronger case for CRUT than Texas counterparts.
- **States with preferential CG rates (Hawaii)** are structurally different: Ch1 is weakened because benchmark annual drag is reduced, while Ch2 still operates at the full ordinary rate. Preferential state CG rates weaken the CRUT's competitive position by approximately 3–6 pp.
- **The state rate × basis heatmap (Fig 4)** shows that high-tax jurisdictions reach the 50% win probability threshold at higher basis fractions — the CRUT is viable for less-appreciated assets in high-tax states.

### Manuscript Implication

The national planning table (Fig 6) is ready for direct manuscript inclusion — it gives every practitioner a single-reference win probability for their jurisdiction at two turnover levels. The California-centric baseline is defended: the paper's primary quantitative conclusions hold across all state tax environments, with California representing a moderately favorable case, not an extreme one. The preferential CG rate finding (Fig 5) is a novel contribution: no existing CRUT literature examines state-level capital gains preferences despite their material impact.

## NB-06 · Return Model Robustness

**Six Checks on the Baseline Assumptions**

### What Was Built

NB-06 is the methodological credibility layer. Six robustness checks test whether the core findings survive when the baseline return-model assumptions are relaxed.

| Check | Figure | What It Tests | Purpose |
|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Path count convergence | Fig 1 | Win prob and CI width as n_paths rises 500 → 10,000 | Confirms n=2,000 achieves < 2pp CI width |
| Volatility sweep | Fig 2 | Win prob vs. σ (8%–30%) at four turnover levels | Addresses concentrated positions (σ = 20–35%) vs. diversified portfolio |
| Return × volatility surface | Fig 3 | Joint μ–σ heatmap with iso-Sharpe contours | Tests whether Sharpe ratio is the sufficient statistic |
| **Student-t distribution** | **Fig 4** | **Log-normal vs. Student-t (df = 5, 10, 20) across σ levels** | **PRIMARY robustness check — fat-tailed equity returns** |
| Sequence of returns risk | Fig 5 | Win prob by early-period return quartile (Q1 = early bad, Q4 = early good) | Tests CRUT exposure to adverse early sequences vs. benchmark |
| Bear market stress test | Fig 6 | Deterministic year-1 return shock (−40% to +20%) across turnover levels | Tests resilience to downturn at CRUT formation |

### The Student-t Check: Primary Robustness Check

The log-normal assumption understates the frequency of extreme market events. Equity returns are empirically leptokurtic. The Student-t with df = 5 captures equity-like kurtosis (excess kurtosis = 6.0 vs. ~0.05 for the log-normal at σ = 12%).

| Property | Log-Normal (σ=12%) | Student-t (df=5, σ=12%) |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Arithmetic mean | 7% | 7% (matched) |
| Standard deviation | 12% | 12% (matched) |
| Excess kurtosis | ~0.05 | 6.0 |
| P(annual return < −30%) | ~0.4% | ~1.8% |
| P(annual return > +50%) | ~0.4% | ~1.8% |

Matching μ and σ exactly isolates distributional shape (kurtosis and tail behavior) from differences in central tendency. The four-panel figure presents: top row — win probability under each distribution at 20% and 60% turnover; bottom row — Student-t minus log-normal difference, green fill where fat tails favor the CRUT, red where they hurt it.

Fat tails affect the two strategies asymmetrically. Large losses reduce the benchmark's embedded gain — automatically shrinking its deferred tax liability, which benefits the benchmark. Large gains proportionally increase CRUT distributions. The bottom row of Fig 4 resolves which effect dominates and by how much.

### Key Findings Across All Six Checks

- **Path count (Fig 1):** The 2pp CI width threshold is reached well before n = 2,000, validating the baseline path count for all other notebooks.
- **Volatility (Fig 2):** Win probability is not monotonically decreasing in σ at all turnover levels. At 0% turnover, higher σ tends to hurt the CRUT. At 60% turnover, the effect reverses — volatile returns generate more annual CG drag for the benchmark.
- **Return × volatility surface (Fig 3):** The 50% decision contour deviates from iso-Sharpe lines, confirming that μ and σ have independent effects — the Sharpe ratio alone is not a sufficient statistic for CRUT win probability.
- **Student-t (Fig 4):** The fat-tail premium is small in absolute terms — typically ±2–4 pp at baseline σ. The direction depends on σ and turnover. The conclusions are not materially sensitive to the distributional assumption.
- **Sequence risk (Fig 5):** The Q4 minus Q1 range is approximately 6–14 pp depending on turnover. The CRUT is somewhat more sensitive to adverse early returns than the benchmark, but not enough to change the overall win probability conclusions for most clients.
- **Bear market stress test (Fig 6):** A −30% year-1 shock reduces win probability by approximately 6–12 pp. The CRUT's deduction — fixed at inception regardless of year-1 performance — provides partial insulation. The benchmark's automatic gain compression in a loss year partially offsets this.

### Manuscript Implication

Path count convergence (Fig 1) belongs in the Methods section as the first validation exhibit — peer reviewers of simulation-based manuscripts routinely ask whether the path count is sufficient. The Student-t check (Fig 4) is the answer to the inevitable reviewer comment that "the log-normal distribution understates tail risk." The sequence of returns analysis (Fig 5) is, to our knowledge, the first published examination of SORR in the CRUT context — a genuine novel contribution. The bear market stress test (Fig 6) directly addresses the practitioner question "should I wait until the market recovers before contributing?" and the deduction-at-inception asymmetry provides a partial answer.
